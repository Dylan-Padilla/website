As the current Graduate Student Representative to the [American Society of Naturalist](https://www.amnat.org/home.html), one of my duties is to assume the lead in organizing at least one annual meeting (online or in person) of the [Graduate Council (GC)](https://asngrads.com/).

This year, I am excited to announce a series of YouTube Shorts called "Beyond Microsoft". This project consists of a number of 60s videos that showcase a wide range of programming tools to perform tasks that scientists carry out on a daily basis. Those tasks include writing papers, making professional presentations, building academic websites, among others.

The idea is to provide a new way for the GC to connect with all scientists using just a smartphone, tablet, or laptop through the YouTube app. YouTube Shorts offers us the ability to interact with viewers by responding to comments with additional videos or stickers through formats such as Q&As.

An important point of this project is that viewers do not require any programming skill, following the content of the videos should be enough for them to reproduce the observations. In addition, I am providing a number of resources that viewers can use as a guide, such as templates, tutorials, scripts, and scientific literature supporting all the material. The resources will be available in both the description of the videos and the comment box.

We are going to release two videos weekly, on Tuesdays and Thursdays, starting in August 2024. Subscribe to the [American Society of Naturalis YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@asnamnat9152) to receive a notification every time a video is dropped. Also, follow us on [X (or Twitter)](https://x.com/asngrads/) to see an interactive description of each video. We hope you enjoy it!
