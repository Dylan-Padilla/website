I am a postdoctoral associate at the [Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies](https://yibs.yale.edu/). My research in both the [Skelly Lab](https://campuspress.yale.edu/skellylab/) and [Munoz Lab](http://www.marthamunoz.com/) focuses on the interplay between evolutionary genomics and ecology to identify the processes that give rise to high diversification rates across the tree of life. In doing so, I use population genetic models and phylogenetic comparative methods to generate hypotheses and draw broad conclusions that can be applied to wide ranges of taxa (e.g., [see here](https://doi.org/10.32942/X26D3R)).

In addition, I conduct experimental evolution studies to examine the frequency of alleles with underlying effects on traits evolving under different selective pressures, which enables me to make strong inferences concerning phenotypic and genetic responses to selection (e.g., [see here](https://academic.oup.com/jeb/article/37/2/201/7485763?login=true)).
